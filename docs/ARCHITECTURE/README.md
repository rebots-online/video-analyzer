2. **[Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)](erd.md)**
   - Database schema design
   - Entity relationships
   - Field descriptions and data types

3. **[Sequence Diagrams](sequence_diagrams.md)**
   - Video upload and analysis flow
   - Video playback with timecodes
   - Real-time analysis processing
   - Error handling flow
   - Multi-user collaboration

4. **[Component Architecture](component_diagram.md)**
   - Frontend component hierarchy
   - Detailed component descriptions
   - State management approach
   - Performance considerations

5. **[Deployment Architecture](deployment.md)**
   - System infrastructure
   - Production deployment setup
   - CI/CD pipeline
   - Security considerations
   - Disaster recovery

## How to Use These Documents

1. **New Team Members**: Start with the [Overview](overview.md) to get a high-level understanding of the system.

2. **Frontend Development**: Refer to the [Component Architecture](component_diagram.md) for UI component structure and [Sequence Diagrams](sequence_diagrams.md) for user flows.

3. **Backend Development**: Check the [ERD](erd.md) for data models and [Deployment](deployment.md) for infrastructure details.

4. **DevOps**: The [Deployment](deployment.md) document contains all infrastructure, CI/CD, and scaling information.

## Generating Diagrams

All diagrams are created using Mermaid.js. You can:

1. View them directly in any Markdown viewer that supports Mermaid (like GitHub, GitLab, or VS Code with Mermaid extension)
2. Use the [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/) to edit or export them
3. Generate static images using the Mermaid CLI

## Keeping Documentation Updated

Please update the relevant documentation when making significant changes to:
- Database schema (update ERD)
- Component structure (update Component Architecture)
- API contracts (update Sequence Diagrams)
- Infrastructure (update Deployment documentation)
